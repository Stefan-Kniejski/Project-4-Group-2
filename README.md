## **Project Description**

Work as a group to solve, analyze, & visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we learned in data bootcamp.

## **Specific Requirements:**
1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

2. You must use at least two of the following:
    * Python Pandas
    * Python Matplotlib
    * HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
    * JavaScript Plotly
    * JavaScript Leaflet
    * SQL Database
    * MongoDB Database
    * Google Cloud SQL
    * Amazon AWS
    * Tableau

**Members:**
* Barbie Hurtado
* Brian Paniagua
* Eze Odimegwu
* Stefan Kniejski
* David Rojas


## **Project Intent:**
Currency-Projector for global currency creates a model that predicts currency trends based on historical data. Use time-series analysis and explore techniques for users to interact with the model for investments or currency trading. Country Segmentation and Regional Analysis to segment currencies based on global behaviors. Use clustering algorithms like K-Means to group similar currencies and offer insights into global currency trends.
